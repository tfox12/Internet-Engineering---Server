Phase 1 : we should be able to send a message to server and it responds with the same message.
          This phase should test the threadpool, socket layer, and socket queue.
Phase 2 : Now that we have the threadpool working and the socket layer can indeed read and write,
          we should be able to process a GET request in accordance with RFC 2616 (HTTP v1.1).
          The conclusion of this phase is after we are able to have the server return a HTML document that
          corisponds to the GET request.
